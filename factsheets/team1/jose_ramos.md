# Factsheet for John Doe

## Sprint 0

Briefly state what you believe were your best contributions to the project during this period. Each of the sections below is mandatory unless otherwise stated. In each of them, you must link to any relevant observable evidence of your work when it exist (e.g., pull requests, specific commits, issues, markdown files) and very briefly explain why you think they are important. When you include an item that you worked on together with other people, state explicitly that that was the case, not forgetting to explain what was your specific role in it.

For the initial sprint, my work was mainly based on market research and creating some questions for the client to answer. In my research, I found some similar technologies, such as [critical manufacturing software](https://www.criticalmanufacturing.com/industries/discrete-manufacturing/) for factory management, that was also used as inspiration for our user stories and product vision regarding system visualization and requirements, and I also found [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for tasks and work management.
