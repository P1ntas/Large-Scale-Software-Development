# Factsheet for Artur Freitas

## Sprint 0

### Contribution
As a Product Owner (PO), i took part towards the approval of the initial technology common basis, contributed to crafting the initial user stories and helped organize the project backlog with all the Product Owners. Also established contact with the client and helped setup the communication environment between the whole class and the client.

## Sprint 1

### Contribution
Like the previous Sprint, continued the communication with the client in order to clarify the doubts that my team had. I also helped to propose some solutions based on the client's feedback. 

### The user story that I am most proud of
My team's user stories: 
- As a User, I want to have a solid database that can store the machine's logs over time, so that I can visualize it later.


## Sprint 2

### Contribution
As a PO, i refined some of the draft user stories in order to simplify the work flow and division between teams.

Additionally, I also enhanced the development.md file regarding the metrics section, specifying each team's velocity in every sprint and aggregating the weight of completed user stories.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of
My team's user stories:
- As a User I want to be able to see a detailed log of a specific machine's characteristics so that I can monitor its state over time;
- As a User, I expect to have reference graphs for each kind of sensor, so that I can train ML models based on them.

## Sprint 3

### Contribution
In this sprint, as i'm the Product Owner, i helped refining the product backlog and actively collaborated with the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the user stories and their priorities. By communicating with them, i addressed questions, provided clarifications, and facilitated discussions to refine the backlog.

Also in this sprint we didn't have the client's feedback, because it wasn't possible for the PO's to meet with the client. But we will try to keep working without the feedback until we gather new information for our teams.

### The user story that I am most proud of
My team's user stories:
- As a User, I expect to have reference graphs for each kind of sensor, so that I can train ML models based on them;

## Sprint 4

### Contribution
Similar to the last sprint, as we didn't have the meeting with the client, it was not possible to have the feedback to improve some of the features or to add some new user stories. 

Apart from that, i once again helped actively to ajust some inconsistencies in the product backlog and collaborated with the team in some technical detail understanding.

### Contributions of other types that I am most proud of
I also helped with the communication across teams, by sharing the progress with the rest of the Product Owner's and understanding their work to give my team mates an overall update.
