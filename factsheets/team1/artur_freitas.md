# Factsheet for Artur Freitas

## Sprint 0

### Contribution
As a Product Owner (PO), i took part towards the approval of the initial technology common basis, contributed to crafting the initial user stories and helped organize the project backlog with all the Product Owners. Also established contact with the client and helped setup the communication environment between the whole class and the client.

## Sprint 1

### Contribution
Like the previous Sprint, continued the communication with the client in order to clarify the doubts that my team had. I also helped to propose some solutions based on the client's feedback. 

### The two user stories that I am most proud of
My team's issues: 
- As a User, I want to have a solid database that can store the machine's logs over time, so that I can visualize it later
- As a User I want to be able to see a detailed log of a specific machine's characteristics so that I can monitor its state over time
