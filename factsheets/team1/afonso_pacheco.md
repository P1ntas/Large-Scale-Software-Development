## Overall Product

Reflect on your specific contributions to the product, technically and as perceived by a user, along the three dimensions below (see Dashboard > Final outcomes > Product). Keep each section below to a maximum of 50 words.


### Technical Soundness

I always used the available technologies and tried to extract the most from them, therefore my contributions to the project were technically sound. For all of the user stories we were assigned,followed this mentality, and we were able to implement them successfully.

### Product Realization

Transforming ideas into reality wasn't always straightforward. However, what we could implement were dashboards and the Data Analytics Page — a proof of successful component integration within our project.


### Value for the Client

In retrospect, my contributions hold significant value for the client. The data analytics page I helped develop was crucial, notifying about machine parameters and enabling quick detection of deviations.
