# Factsheet for João Araújo

## Sprint 0

At the initial stage, I believe I've done the most crucial work of building the [first prototype](../../docs/development.md#technology). For this prototype, I've done extensive research to find the technologies that would suit our needs and would be doable for our time frame. This prototype was essential to show the other elements that did not have a clear visual representation of the product we are going to build. 

I've done the [development guide](../../docs/development.md#development-guide) for the first prototype, as well as I've setup all the necessary tools to build it in a docker container, all by running a single file. I believe the stated documentation is clear and concise, and it will be easy for the other elements to build the prototype on their machines and to understand the technologies that are being used.

Also, after the first two Q&A sessions with the client, I've come up with new technologies that are likely to be used on the project, which can be found [here](../../docs/development.md#second-prototype---to-be-done-in-the-following-sprints).

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

The two PRs I'm most proud are:
- [#12](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/12) - The development of the Architecture and Design of models eased the visualization of the technologies to be used.
- [#17](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/17) - The inclusion of the first prototype in the repository was a crucial step to show the integration of the first technologies that we were going to use, as well as an easy way to build the prototype on the other's machines.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- As stated initially, I've done the most crucial work of building the first prototype. This prototype was essential to show the other elements that did not have a clear visual representation of the product we are going to build.

## Sprint 1


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [#13](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/13) - The successful integration of [DINASORE](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/13) on the project. This was essential to show the client that our project is feasible to be used in any kind of environment, as well as it is easy to integrate the pipeline with other technologies that may come.

- [#4](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/4) - The integration of a new dashboard in Grafana that is more user-friendly and has more information than the previous one.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [#27](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/27) - Fixed DINASORE's features to be used in our project with ease.

- [#34](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/32) - Sucessfuly integrated DINASORE into our project with [Team 2](../team2/team2.md). This integration was essential to show the client that our project is feasible to be updated by managers that would use this later on, since the pipeline is fully customizable.


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- I've done the documentation of DINASORE and gave an easy to follow tutorial for the others elements to follow and customize the pipeline to their needs later on.

- I've been helping [Team 2](../team2/team2.md) and [Team 4](../team4/team4.md) to integrate DINASORE into the project and help to develop a solid sensor generator that gives the necessary data to train their models, respectively.

## Sprint 2

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [#28](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/28) - Sucessfuly created new reference graphs for the newly created sensors. Added unit testing to these sensors and created a function block, in DINASORE, to generate the data for these sensors according to the type.

- [#29](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/29) - Helped [Team 2](../team2/team2.md) in the dockerization of the DINASORE pipeline and the creation of the docker-compose file to run the pipeline with ease.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [#65](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/65) - Fixed [Team 2](../team2/team2.md) minor bugs on dockerization of DINASORE and updated the docker-compose.yml file to run the pipeline on docker with ease.

- [#66](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/66) - Created a function block in DINASORE to generate data for the new sensors which closes the issue [#28](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/28).

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- I've been helping [Team 4](../team4/team4.md) with the types of data generated by the diferent sensors so that they can use on their Machine Learning models.

- I've helped integrate github actions to the project so that we can have a better CI/CD pipeline and have a better overview of the project's status.

## Sprint 3

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [#102](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/102) - Sucessfuly created new visualizations in Grafana with the details of a systems job scheduler. Also displays the jobs running at a given time and allows the user to see the details of a given job.

- [#98](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/98) - Together with [Team 2](../team2/team2.md), we fixed the documentation content distribution across multiple files and fixed previous documentation issues.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [#114](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/114) - This PR was essential to add the new Grafana visualizations to the development branch according to a systems job scheduler.

- [#101](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/101) - Updated the documentation and the Changelog to reflect the changes made in the project in sprint 2.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- I've been helping [Team 2](../team2/team2.md) with the fix of the documentation content distribution across multiple files and fixed previous documentation issues.

- I've helped my team members to understand the new view of the project according to the client's feedback and helped them to understand the new requirements for the next sprint.
