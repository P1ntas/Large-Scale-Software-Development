# Factsheet for João Araújo

## Sprint 0

Briefly state what you believe were your best contributions to the project during this period. Each of the sections below is mandatory unless otherwise stated. In each of them, you must link to any relevant observable evidence of your work when it exist (e.g., pull requests, specific commits, issues, markdown files) and very briefly explain why you think they are important. When you include an item that you worked on together with other people, state explicitly that that was the case, not forgetting to explain what was your specific role in it.

At the initial stage, I believe I've done the most crucial work of building the [first prototype](../../docs/development.md#technology). For this prototype, I've done extensive research to find the technologies that would suit our needs and would be doable for our time frame. This prototype was essential to show the other elements that did not have a clear visual representation of the product we are going to build. 

I've done the [development guide](../../docs/development.md#development-guide) for the first prototype, as well as I've setup all the necessary tools to build it in a docker container, all by running a single file. I believe the stated documentation is clear and concise, and it will be easy for the other elements to build the prototype on their machines and to understand the technologies that are being used.

Also, after the first two Q&A sessions with the client, I've come up with new technologies that are likely to be used on the project, which can be found [here](../../docs/development.md#second-prototype---to-be-done-in-the-following-sprints).


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.




### The two pull requests that I am most proud of


The two PRs I'm most proud are:
- The inclusion of the first prototype in the repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/tree/208f0ecaeb8a9f2911daacb6136ff76c726556b4).

- The development of the Architecture and Design of models, which can be found [here](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/tree/8283b49fe9c5d2a5169c1090b1db279b8b985ad4).


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- As stated initially, I've done the most crucial work of building the first prototype. This prototype was essential to show the other elements that did not have a clear visual representation of the product we are going to build.

- I've done the development guide for the first prototype, as well as I've setup all the necessary tools to build it in a docker container, all by running a single file.
