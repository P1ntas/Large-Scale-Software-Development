# Factsheet for João Araújo

## Sprint 0

At the initial stage, I believe I've done the most crucial work of building the [first prototype](../../docs/development.md#technology). For this prototype, I've done extensive research to find the technologies that would suit our needs and would be doable for our time frame. This prototype was essential to show the other elements that did not have a clear visual representation of the product we are going to build. 

I've done the [development guide](../../docs/development.md#development-guide) for the first prototype, as well as I've setup all the necessary tools to build it in a docker container, all by running a single file. I believe the stated documentation is clear and concise, and it will be easy for the other elements to build the prototype on their machines and to understand the technologies that are being used.

Also, after the first two Q&A sessions with the client, I've come up with new technologies that are likely to be used on the project, which can be found [here](../../docs/development.md#second-prototype---to-be-done-in-the-following-sprints).

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

The two PRs I'm most proud are:
- [#12](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/12) - The development of the Architecture and Design of models eased the visualization of the technologies to be used.
- [#17](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/17) - The inclusion of the first prototype in the repository was a crucial step to show the integration of the first technologies that we were going to use, as well as an easy way to build the prototype on the other's machines.

## Overall Product

### Technical Soundness

The chosen technologies, including DINASORE, Grafana, Docker, and Prometheus are a good fit for the architecture of the project. They provide the necessary tools and functionalities to address the problem at hand effectively. The implementation demonstrates a good application of these technologies, showcasing their capabilities and integrating them seamlessly. The code is easy to understand, maintainable, and robust, ensuring the long-term viability of the project.

### Product Realization

During the development of the project, my team and I implemented various features and improvements that contribute to a viable product for the problem at hand. The product has a professional feel to it, exhibiting the required quality attributes. It also adheres to the technical constraints and is ready to be delivered to the client. These contributions were well received by the client, indicating that the final product meets their needs and will be easy for them to use.

### Value for the Client

After the last Q&A session with the client, which we also presented the final product, the client was pleased with the final product and the work we've done. Although some minor points were raised, the part of the product that was implemented by my team and I was well received by the client. We believe that the client will be able to use the product with ease and that it will be useful for the his needs. Overall, the effort put into the project was quite above the expected for the curricular unit, but it is expected in such a project whose goal is to be used in a real-world scenario and should be fine-tuned to the client's needs and required some trial and error to get on par with the client's expectations.
