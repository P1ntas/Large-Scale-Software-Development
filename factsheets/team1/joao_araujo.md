# Factsheet for João Araújo

## Sprint 0

At the initial stage, I believe I've done the most crucial work of building the [first prototype](../../docs/development.md#technology). For this prototype, I've done extensive research to find the technologies that would suit our needs and would be doable for our time frame. This prototype was essential to show the other elements that did not have a clear visual representation of the product we are going to build. 

I've done the [development guide](../../docs/development.md#development-guide) for the first prototype, as well as I've setup all the necessary tools to build it in a docker container, all by running a single file. I believe the stated documentation is clear and concise, and it will be easy for the other elements to build the prototype on their machines and to understand the technologies that are being used.

Also, after the first two Q&A sessions with the client, I've come up with new technologies that are likely to be used on the project, which can be found [here](../../docs/development.md#second-prototype---to-be-done-in-the-following-sprints).

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

The two PRs I'm most proud are:
- [#12](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/12) - The development of the Architecture and Design of models eased the visualization of the technologies to be used.
- [#17](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/17) - The inclusion of the first prototype in the repository was a crucial step to show the integration of the first technologies that we were going to use, as well as an easy way to build the prototype on the other's machines.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- As stated initially, I've done the most crucial work of building the first prototype. This prototype was essential to show the other elements that did not have a clear visual representation of the product we are going to build.

## Sprint 1


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

- [#13](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/13) - The successful integration of [DINASORE](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/13) on the project. This was essential to show the client that our project is feasible to be used in any kind of environment, as well as it is easy to integrate the pipeline with other technologies that may come.

- [#4](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/4) - The integration of a new dashboard in Grafana that is more user-friendly and has more information than the previous one.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

- [#27](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/27) - Fixed DINASORE's features to be used in our project with ease.

- [#34](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/32) - Sucessfuly integrated DINASORE into our project with [Team 2](../team2/team2.md). This integration was essential to show the client that our project is feasible to be updated by managers that would use this later on, since the pipeline is fully customizable.


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- I've done the documentation of DINASORE and gave an easy to follow tutorial for the others elements to follow and customize the pipeline to their needs later on.

- I've been helping [Team 2](../team2/team2.md) and [Team 3](../team4/team4.md) to integrate DINASORE into the project and help to develop a solid sensor generator that gives the necessary data to train their models, respectively.
