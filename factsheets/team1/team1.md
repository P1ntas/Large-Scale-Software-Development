# Factsheet for Team 1 

## Sprint 0

Our team played a pivotal role in establishing the project's foundation. We collectively approved the initial technology framework, organized the project backlog, and initiated client communication.

During the project's start, our team led the creation of our first prototype through thorough research, simplifying the setup process in a Docker container. Clear documentation made it accessible to the teams. We identified new technologies following client Q&A sessions.

In this sprint, our focus was on teamwork and market research. Our research uncovered technologies like critical manufacturing software and Notion for project inspiration and management.


### The four user stories that we are most proud of

- [#14](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/14) As a User, I want to have a solid database that can store the machine's logs over time, so that I can visualize it later
- [#4](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/4) As a User I want to be able to see a detailed log of a specific machine's characteristics so that I can monitor its state over time

### The four pull requests that we are most proud of

The two PRs we're most proud of:
- [#12](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/12) - The development of the Architecture and Design of models eased the visualization of the technologies to be used.
- [#17](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/17) - The inclusion of the first prototype in the repository was a crucial step to show the integration of the first technologies that we were going to use, as well as an easy way to build the prototype on the other's machines.


### Four contributions of other types that we are most proud of

- One of our most critical achievements was the development of the first prototype. This prototype served as a crucial visual representation for elements of our team that required a clearer understanding of the project.

- We also authored a comprehensive development guide for this initial prototype, streamlining the setup process in a Docker container through a single-file setup. The documentation is designed to be clear and concise, ensuring that all team members can easily replicate the prototype on their own machines and grasp the underlying technologies.

- Our market research played a vital role in shaping various aspects of the project, including the creation of user stories, the product vision, questions related to the system, and many other key elements.

- We contributed to the project startup regarding the technologies used for future work.


## Sprint 1


In this Sprint, our team maintained our ongoing communication with the client, addressing any uncertainties and seeking clarification. We actively engaged in proposing solutions based on the valuable feedback provided by the client.

Additionally, we were was tasked with the responsibility of upgrading the existing database schema, helping other teams with tasks like integrating DINASORE and making adicional dashboards in grafana.


### The four user stories that we are most proud of

- [#13](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/13) - The successful integration of [DINASORE](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/13) on the project. This was essential to show the client that our project is feasible to be used in any kind of environment, as well as it is easy to integrate the pipeline with other technologies that may come.

- [#4](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/4) - The integration of a new dashboard in Grafana that is more user-friendly and has more information than the previous one.

- [#14](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/14) - Did the database squema. Probably will need to upgrade in the future.

- [#13](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/13) - Helped team 2 in the progression of the user stories.

### The four pull requests that we are most proud of

- [#27](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/27) - Fixed DINASORE's features to be used in our project with ease.

- [#34](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/32) - Sucessfuly integrated DINASORE into our project with [Team 2](../team2/team2.md). This integration was essential to show the client that our project is feasible to be updated by managers that would use this later on, since the pipeline is fully customizable.

- [#49](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/49) - Uploaded the new database uml.

### Four contributions of other types that we are most proud of

- We've undertaken the task of documenting DINASORE, providing a user-friendly tutorial for our fellow team members.

- In addition to our documentation work, we've been actively assisting [Team 2](../team2/team2.md) and [Team 3](../team4/team4.md) in integrating DINASORE into the project. 

- We've been instrumental in the development of a robust sensor generator, ensuring that it generates the essential data needed to train their respective models effectively.

- The documentation we did empowers others to easily follow and customize the pipeline to suit their specific requirements in the future.
