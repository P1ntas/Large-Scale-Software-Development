# Factsheet for Team 1 

## Sprint 0

Our team played a pivotal role in establishing the project's foundation. We collectively approved the initial technology framework, organized the project backlog, and initiated client communication.

During the project's start, our team led the creation of our first prototype through thorough research, simplifying the setup process in a Docker container. Clear documentation made it accessible to the teams. We identified new technologies following client Q&A sessions.

In this sprint, our focus was on teamwork and market research. Our research uncovered technologies like critical manufacturing software and Notion for project inspiration and management.


### The four user stories that we are most proud of

- [#14](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/14) As a User, I want to have a solid database that can store the machine's logs over time, so that I can visualize it later
- [#4](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/4) As a User I want to be able to see a detailed log of a specific machine's characteristics so that I can monitor its state over time

### The four pull requests that we are most proud of

The two PRs we're most proud of:
- [#12](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/12) - The development of the Architecture and Design of models eased the visualization of the technologies to be used.
- [#17](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/17) - The inclusion of the first prototype in the repository was a crucial step to show the integration of the first technologies that we were going to use, as well as an easy way to build the prototype on the other's machines.


### Four contributions of other types that we are most proud of

- One of our most critical achievements was the development of the first prototype. This prototype served as a crucial visual representation for elements of our team that required a clearer understanding of the project.

- We also authored a comprehensive development guide for this initial prototype, streamlining the setup process in a Docker container through a single-file setup. The documentation is designed to be clear and concise, ensuring that all team members can easily replicate the prototype on their own machines and grasp the underlying technologies.

- Our market research played a vital role in shaping various aspects of the project, including the creation of user stories, the product vision, questions related to the system, and many other key elements.

- We contributed to the project startup regarding the technologies used for future work.
