## Sprint 1


In this Sprint, our team maintained our ongoing communication with the client, addressing any uncertainties and seeking clarification. We actively engaged in proposing solutions based on the valuable feedback provided by the client.

Additionally, we were was tasked with the responsibility of upgrading the existing database schema, helping other teams with tasks like integrating DINASORE and making adicional dashboards in grafana.


### The four user stories that we are most proud of

- [#13](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/13) - The successful integration of [DINASORE](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/13) on the project. This was essential to show the client that our project is feasible to be used in any kind of environment, as well as it is easy to integrate the pipeline with other technologies that may come.

- [#4](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/4) - The integration of a new dashboard in Grafana that is more user-friendly and has more information than the previous one.

- [#14](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/14) - Did the database squema. Probably will need to upgrade in the future.

### The four pull requests that we are most proud of

- [#27](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/27) - Fixed DINASORE's features to be used in our project with ease.

- [#34](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/32) - Sucessfuly integrated DINASORE into our project with [Team 2](../team2/team2.md). This integration was essential to show the client that our project is feasible to be updated by managers that would use this later on, since the pipeline is fully customizable.

### Four contributions of other types that we are most proud of

- We've undertaken the task of documenting DINASORE, providing a user-friendly tutorial for our fellow team members. This documentation empowers others to easily follow and customize the pipeline to suit their specific requirements in the future.

- In addition to our documentation work, we've been actively assisting [Team 2](../team2/team2.md) and [Team 3](../team4/team4.md) in integrating DINASORE into the project. Furthermore, we've been instrumental in the development of a robust sensor generator, ensuring that it generates the essential data needed to train their respective models effectively.
