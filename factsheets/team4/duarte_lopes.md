## Overall Product

Reflect on your specific contributions to the product, technically and as perceived by a user, along the three dimensions below (see Dashboard > Final outcomes > Product). Keep each section below to a maximum of 50 words.


### Technical Soundness

I worked in data modeling and grafana dashboards. My first job was getting the data ready and creating the machine learning models. The dashboards were made to be easily readible and add value to the user experience. These things improved how well the product works.


### Product Realization

I played a key role in making ideas into a real product. I did important things like cleaning up data and setting up machine learning. The Grafana dashboard I made is actually something the end user might find very useful and was definetly worth the time spent in implemention.

### Value for the Client

I made valuable additions to the product such as the AI to help with decisions and a dashboard that's easy for users to read information using filtering and ordering. This helps the client and gives them advantages like knowing the distribution of machines, saving energy, or getting better insights.
