1. **Client Collaboration**: Team 4 played a key role in liaising with the client to understand their requirements. We facilitated effective communication between the Product Owner (PO) and the Development Team, ensuring that the client's vision was accurately represented in the project. This close collaboration was essential in aligning our efforts with the client's expectations.

2. **Framework and Technology Evaluation**: We undertook a comprehensive evaluation of thePrometheus framework and Grafana. This involved researching and testing these technologies to ensure they aligned with the project's goals.

3. **Requirement Clarity**: We actively worked on clarifying requirements during discussions with the client. This was crucial in eliminating any ambiguities and uncertainties.

4. **Adaptation to Client Needs**: We were agile in our approach and made necessary adjustments to the frameworks and technologies based on feedback from the second meeting with the client. This adaptability allowed us to better cater to the client's evolving needs and ensure the project was on the right track from the beginning.

Our team's contributions in Sprint 0 set a solid foundation for the project, aligning our efforts with the client's vision.
