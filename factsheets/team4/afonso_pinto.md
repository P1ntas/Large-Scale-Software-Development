# Factsheet for Afonso Pinto

## Sprint 0

Briefly state what you believe were your best contributions to the project during this period. Each of the sections below is mandatory unless otherwise stated. In each of them, you must link to any relevant observable evidence of your work when it exist (e.g., pull requests, specific commits, issues, markdown files) and very briefly explain why you think they are important. When you include an item that you worked on together with other people, state explicitly that that was the case, not forgetting to explain what was your specific role in it.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

 * #1 Create an alert after some amount of time for a periodic check on any given machine
 * #2


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint.

 * #3 product.md branch
 * #4 fact_sheets_team4


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

 Wrote a market research  text for product.md, and created a user story for our project to create an alert after some amount of time for a periodic check on any given machine.



## Sprint 1

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

 * #1 As a user, I want the system to store all monitoring data for future use in enhancing and training the machine learning model. This data will be crucial for improving the system's autonomous decision-making capabilities. 
 * #2 As a user, I expect the system to utilize a knowledge base and machine learning algorithms to autonomously make decisions about what is necessary for the machine's efficient operation. I rely on the system's AI to determine maintenance and operational needs. 


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint.

 * #3 team4-sprint1
 * #4 


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

I initiated the process by creating a script to generate mock-up data, which served as the foundation for our training and testing data. Subsequently, I meticulously processed and prepared the data for analysis. Additionally, 

I also took the lead in training two critical machine learning models: Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These models will play a significant role in the system's ability to autonomously make decisions related to maintenance and operational needs, enabling more informed and efficient operations.


## Sprint 2

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

 * #1 ML model - Data Preparation - Issue 1
 * #2 ML model - Data Preparation - Issue 2 - helped on data generation


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint.

 * #3 feature/data analysis 


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

I worked data on data preparation. I indentified data to be cleanse, checked for correlation between different variables and which ones would be preferable for our model.

I also helped on data generation in order to train our model


## Sprint 3

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * #1 ML model - Model Evaluation
 * #2 ML model - Data Pipeline
 * #3 As a user, I expect the system to utilize a knowledge base and machine learning algorithms to autonomously make decisions about what is necessary for the machine's efficient operation. I rely on the system's AI to determine maintenance and operational needs.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint.

 * #3 feature/sensor_data_machine_learning


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

Identified the data that would be useful to train our model, such as `temperature`, `pressure`, `vibration`, `humidity` and `airflow`, among many others. I also created python scripts to generate enough data to train our model.

After that, I worked on the data preparation, splitting and subsequent trained 3 models to best predict whether any given sensor would fail and/or need maintenance.

Finally, I tried to improve the models by utilising hyperparameter tuning. The models achieved an accuracy of around 75% to 80%.


## Sprint 4

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * #1 As a User I want to be able to see a detailed page about a specific machine I choose so that I can monitor its current, real-time state


### The pull request that I am most proud of

This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint.

 * #3 feature/machine_page


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of


In creating the Grafana dashboard for monitoring factory machines, two contributions I am particularly proud of are:

<b>Maintenance Alerts Panel:</b> This element enhances proactive maintenance planning by displaying upcoming scheduled maintenance events. It helps in minimizing unexpected downtimes and extending machine lifespan.

<b>Energy Consumption Graph:</b> This graph provides real-time insights into the energy usage of machines. It is instrumental for identifying patterns in energy consumption, enabling the implementation of energy-saving measures and reducing operational costs.
