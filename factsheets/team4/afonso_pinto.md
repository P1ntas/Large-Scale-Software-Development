# Factsheet for Afonso Pinto

## Sprint 0

Briefly state what you believe were your best contributions to the project during this period. Each of the sections below is mandatory unless otherwise stated. In each of them, you must link to any relevant observable evidence of your work when it exist (e.g., pull requests, specific commits, issues, markdown files) and very briefly explain why you think they are important. When you include an item that you worked on together with other people, state explicitly that that was the case, not forgetting to explain what was your specific role in it.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

 * #1 Create an alert after some amount of time for a periodic check on any given machine
 * #2


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint.

 * #3 product.md branch
 * #4 fact_sheets_team4


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

 Wrote a market research  text for product.md, and created a user story for our project to create an alert after some amount of time for a periodic check on any given machine.



## Sprint 1

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

 * #1 As a user, I want the system to store all monitoring data for future use in enhancing and training the machine learning model. This data will be crucial for improving the system's autonomous decision-making capabilities. 
 * #2 As a user, I expect the system to utilize a knowledge base and machine learning algorithms to autonomously make decisions about what is necessary for the machine's efficient operation. I rely on the system's AI to determine maintenance and operational needs. 


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint.

 * #3 team4-sprint1
 * #4 


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

I initiated the process by creating a script to generate mock-up data, which served as the foundation for our training and testing data. Subsequently, I meticulously processed and prepared the data for analysis. Additionally, 

I also took the lead in training two critical machine learning models: Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These models will play a significant role in the system's ability to autonomously make decisions related to maintenance and operational needs, enabling more informed and efficient operations.
