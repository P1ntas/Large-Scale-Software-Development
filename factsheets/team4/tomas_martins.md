# Factsheet for Tom√°s Martins

## Sprint 0

My major contributions consisted about searching for possible technologies to use, mainly related with database ones, like Firebase. In the end, we went with PostgreSQL, as proposed by one of my colleagues.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

I contributed to this [issue](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/9), by helping to make the tasks that the development team will have to carry out clearer and more to the point.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

(N/A) in sprint 0.


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

(N/A) in sprint 0.


## Sprint 1

My major contributions consisted guidance to Team 4's dev team and collective brainstorms to clarify how we would proceed from sprint 1 onwards. Some work was done, about connecting the database to the future ML model, but that's far from done.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

During sprint 1, no user stories were created by me or with my contribution.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No relevant pull requests were created by me during sprint 1, besides some for documentation and the some that I approved but didn't create.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

Besides guiding my dev team and the contribution I did to establish a better communication between team members and between us and other teams, there's nothing to highlight.

## Sprint 2

My major contributions consisted on guidance to Team 4's dev team and collective brainstorms to clarify how we would proceed from sprint 2 onwards. As a scrum master, participated in two meetings with the other scrum masters from other teams and helped with the creation and implementation of working guidelines.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

By splitting our [epic](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/8) into three smaller issues:

- [#53](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/53)
- [#54](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/54)
- [#55](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/55)

Those issues still need refinement, more specifically on the structure (convert them into user stories style and creating a well defined task list).

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No relevant pull requests were created by me during sprint 2, besides some for documentation and the some that I approved but didn't create.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- Guiding my dev team and the contribution I did to establish a better communication between team members and between us and other teams.
- Meeting the other scrum masters and establishing working guideline such as the structure of commit messages, branch naming, pull requests' names, etc.

## Sprint 3

In this sprint, the work was more around helping my team members further understanding the guidelines and helping them understand the workarounds of the tech stack chosen (and continuously being updated) and the system itself, in order for them to work with much more ease.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No relevant pull requests were created by me during sprint 3, besides some for documentation and the some that I approved but didn't create.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- Guiding my dev team and the contribution I did to establish a better communication between team members and between us and other teams.
- Meeting the other scrum masters and being on watch about if the working guidelines are being complied with, such as the structure of commit messages, branch naming, pull requests' names, etc.


## Sprint 4

Worked with my team members (dev's) to help them with the issues that were assigned to them, i.e. the page that shows the machines available, with the proper filtering options to adjust the display settings.

Even if some issues were successfully implemented, the most important one, regarding ML, couldn't be completely finished. 

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

Besides PR[#156](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/156), no relevant pull requests were created by me during sprint 4, besides some for documentation, for the project structure refactoring process and the ones that I approved but didn't create and were created by the developers of my team.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- Guiding my dev team and the contribution I did to establish a better communication between team members and between us and other teams.
- Meeting the other scrum masters and being on watch about if the working guidelines are being complied with, such as the structure of commit messages, branch naming, pull requests' names, etc.


## Overall Product

### Technical Soundness

Having familiarized myself with the technologies, I discovered their user-friendly nature and suitability for the task. With prior knowledge, I could have contributed more, assisting with UI, optimization, and guiding the creation of a machine learning model, defining the approach and task distribution.

### Product Realization

Despite being far from finished, the product has most of the functionalities requested by the client. The client was satisfied and understood the lack of integration of the ML model, recognising the effort put into researching and creating it, a process to which I contributed.

### Value for the Client

The handover was successful, and the client approved the work I was part of, despite the constraint of using DINASORE, that limited everyone in time, as we had to learn a new technology from scratch. Although research and study consumed most of the time, my effort matched the expected timeframe for this curricular unit.
