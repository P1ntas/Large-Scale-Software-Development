# Factsheet for TomÃ¡s Martins

## Sprint 0

My major contributions consisted about searching for possible technologies to use, mainly related with database ones, like Firebase. In the end, we went with PostgreSQL, as proposed by one of my colleagues.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

I contributed to this [issue](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/9), by helping to make the tasks that the development team will have to carry out clearer and more to the point.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

(N/A) in sprint 0.


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

(N/A) in sprint 0.


## Sprint 1

My major contributions consisted guidance to Team 4's dev team and collective brainstorms to clarify how we would proceed from sprint 1 onwards. Some work was done, about connecting the database to the future ML model, but that's far from done.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

During sprint 1, no user stories were created by me or with my contribution.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No relevant pull requests were created by me during sprint 1, besides some for documentation and the some that I approved but didn't create.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

Besides guiding my dev team and the contribution I did to establish a better communication between team members and between us and other teams, there's nothing to highlight.

## Sprint 2

My major contributions consisted on guidance to Team 4's dev team and collective brainstorms to clarify how we would proceed from sprint 2 onwards. As a scrum master, participated in two meetings with the other scrum masters from other teams and helped with the creation and implementation of working guidelines.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

By splitting our [epic](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/8) into three smaller issues:

-[#53](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/53)
-[#54](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/54)
-[#55](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/55)

Those issues still need refinement, more specifically on the structure (convert them into user stories style and creating a well defined task list).

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

No relevant pull requests were created by me during sprint 2, besides some for documentation and the some that I approved but didn't create.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- Guiding my dev team and the contribution I did to establish a better communication between team members and between us and other teams.
- Meeting the other scrum masters and establishing working guideline such as the structure of commit messages, branch naming, pull requests' names, etc.
