# Factsheet for Tiago Marques

## Sprint 0

Since this sprint was more focused on understanding and planning the project, and not so in developing code, I can't say that I had a great contribution. I may have discussed some topics with my team, but nothing to complex or specific.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

In this sprint I discussed some topics with my team and developed some code in python to generate the reference data for the temperature and pressure sensors (it was also supposed to generate the reference data for the flow rates, but that was not done). Also, by developing that code I also generated the correspondent csv files.



## Sprint 1

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * Not really a user story, but it was something that was indicated to me and useful at the moment, since we do not have real data from the sensors, we needed to generate it by ourselves. That's what I did as stated above.


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

 * I haven't already asked for a pull request for the data I generated, but I believe it will be done soon.
