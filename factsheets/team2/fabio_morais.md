# Factsheet for Fábio Morais

## Sprint 0

 Took part in the writing of the initial user stories 



## Sprint 1

At first analysis of the dinasore repository in order to get familiar with this tool. This included the completion of the tutorial that was later discussed by the whole team in a meeting with the objective of setting a good starting point for the sprint.
Later in the sprint worked mostly together with [João Araújo](../team1/joao_araujo.md) in the creation of a dinasore project that would simulate data from a sensor and write it to prometheus. My part would consist mostly in reproducing the project made by João locally testing that everything was working as it should. This reproduction followed different steps from his work which led to deal with different problems. I also took part in the giving of feedback that helped in the creation of the setup guide and documentation. 


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- My contribution in the first team meeting was important in the familiarization of the group with dinasore and on the set of the good environment for the sprint
- The support gave to João, which was already much more familiar with this environment, is something im proud since it made me have to adapt to his speed and workflow

#### The user story that I am most proud of
 * [#29](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/29)  

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint.

 * #3 [83] (https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/83)
 * #4 [52] (https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/52)


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- The help given to the team regarding the dockerization which was the main task for our group.
- The update of the documentation regarding the new sensor simulator which led me to integrate it in the pipeline with the help of João (responsible for the creation of this FB) and test it in order to find the correct parameters. As this was done after the dockerization it included updating also the documentation regarding other parameters, mainly hosts.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- Worked together with João in the machine's job schedule display. This led among other things to a change in the mockup data adding the task concept that would be used in grafana's state timeline. 
- Took part in the work distribution, contributing for a better workflow inside the team.
