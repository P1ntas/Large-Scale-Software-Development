# Factsheet for Fábio Morais

## Sprint 0

 Took part in the writing of the initial user stories 



## Sprint 1

At first analysis of the dinasore repository in order to get familiar with this tool. This included the completion of the tutorial that was later discussed by the whole team in a meeting with the objective of setting a good starting point for the sprint.
Later in the sprint worked mostly together with [João Araújo](../team1/joao_araujo.md) in the creation of a dinasore project that would simulate data from a sensor and write it to prometheus. My part would consist mostly in reproducing the project made by João locally testing that everything was working as it should. This reproduction followed different steps from his work which led to deal with different problems. I also took part in the giving of feedback that helped in the creation of the setup guide and documentation. 


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

- My contribution in the first team meeting was important in the familiarization of the group with dinasore and on the set of the good environment for the sprint
- The support gave to João, which was already much more familiar with this environment, is something im proud since it made me have to adapt to his speed and workflow
