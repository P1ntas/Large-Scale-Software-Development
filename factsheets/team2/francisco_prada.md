# Factsheet for Francisco Prada

## Sprint 0

Since this sprint was mainly used for the creation of user stories and other related content, there was no real contributions on my part as Scrum Master, except maybe for a basic review of some of the created issues.

## Sprint 1

### General considerations
In this sprint, we were more concerned about understanding the workflow of the DINASORE tool. With this in mind, we went through the presented tutorials, step by step, in order for us to have a full grasp on how the Function Block programming works. Furthermore, we already tested it out with a custom pipeline, which was aligned with the client's perspective.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of
As mentioned before, I worked more on the part of understanding and usage of the DINASORE tool.
- Setted up DINASORE and helped the other members of the team when needed
- Tested the pipeline created by [João Araújo](../factsheets/team1/joao_araujo.md)

## Sprint 2

### General considerations
In this second sprint, I continued to develop my tasks as Scrum Master and help my team through some hardships on their work, trying to solve them, and take some issues on my own. However, in retrospective, there should have been a better communication as SM with the other team members at the beginning of the sprint, although this mistake was corrected through it.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of
- [DINASORE Dockerization](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/52): although I did not assign myself on it, my contribution on this PR is explained below.
- [CI/CD Integration](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/71): although we will probably add some other tools to the CI/CD thoughout the remaining sprints, I already configured some such as Pylint, Python Package using Conda for the Continuous Integration.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of
- Helped in the Dockerization issue, although I could not completely correct some errors that appeared along the way.


## Sprint 3

### General consideration 
In this third sprint, I was no longer the Scrum Master and focused on fixing the CI tools, mainly the linter and package manager. I also helped my teammates by reviewing some of their Pull Requests.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of
- [#97 - Fix the CI tools problems ](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/97): this issue was created originally from another user story: [#62](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/62). It was focused more on fixing and upgrading the integration of the CI/CD.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of
- [#105 - Fix: CI Integration](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/105): as previously mentioned, this PR was intended to fix some problems with th CI tools. The configuration files for the pylint and bandit linters and package managers were altered so they wouldn't raise exceptions with default DINASORE blocks. This PR was made together with [Alexandre Costa](https://github.com/alexlcosta) and [Diogo Fonte](https://github.com/diogofonte).

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of
I also reviewed the PR's of [Test Coverage](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/116#pullrequestreview-1758656296) which implements the SonarQube tests and a [fix](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/120) when merging both SonarQube and the CI tools.
