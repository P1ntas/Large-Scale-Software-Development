# Factsheet for Francisco Prada

## Sprint 0

Since this sprint was mainly used for the creation of user stories and other related content, there was no real contributions on my part as Scrum Master, except maybe for a basic review of some of the created issues.

## Sprint 1

### General considerations
In this sprint, we were more concerned about understanding the workflow of the DINASORE tool. With this in mind, we went through the presented tutorials, step by step, in order for us to have a full grasp on how the Function Block programming works. Furthermore, we already tested it out with a custom pipeline, which was aligned with the client's perspective.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of
As mentioned before, I worked more on the part of understanding and usage of the DINASORE tool.
- Setted up DINASORE and helped the other members of the team when needed
- Tested the pipeline created by [João Araújo](../factsheets/team1/joao_araujo.md)
