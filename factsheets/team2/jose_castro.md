## Sprint 1

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * Team 2's Issues - DINASORE Implementation, Dockerization and other DINASORE-related backlog items 

### General Contributions

Continued working with the client to further understand the need for the DINASORE technology in this project. Familiarized myself with the development environment and technologies so I could better communicate the team's questions and feedback in more technical questions, and followed the team's progress closely to source out doubts that needed to be answered. Prepared sprint backlog with the help of the team.
