# Factsheet for JosÃ© Castro

## Sprint 0

### General Contributions

Contributed towards the approval of the initial technology common basis, took part in the writing of the initial user stories and helped organize the project backlog. Actively established contact with the client and setup the communication environment.

## Sprint 1

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * Team 2's Issues - DINASORE Implementation, Dockerization and other DINASORE-related backlog items 

### General Contributions

Continued working with the client to further understand the need for the DINASORE technology in this project. Familiarized myself with the development environment and technologies so I could better communicate the team's questions and feedback in more technical questions, and followed the team's progress closely to source out doubts that needed to be answered. Prepared sprint backlog with the help of the team.

## Sprint 2

### The two user stories that I am most proud of
- [#62 - Setup CI/CD Environment](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/62)
- [#82- Job Scheduling Feature](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/82)

### General Contributions

Continuous communication with the team. Familiarized myself with CI/CD environments and cloud services for production servers and started said setup of production server, and drew up the issues to tackle these needs. Communicated with client to understand priorities moving forward.


## Sprint 3

### General consideration 

Along with my Product Owner duties, I actively participated in the setup of the both the deployment server and the automation of said deployment, which I started in the middle of the last sprint. Because of problems with the virtual machine, which had to be setup three different times because of crashes over an extended period of time (presumably due to the heavy load the DINASORE and SonarQube containers); and problems with the Github Action for deployment, whose functionalities were not fully working (a common problem that came up when discussing deployment automation with other colleagues), my progress was halted significantly. However, I am sure that, by the end of the first week of the next sprint, everything will be deploying smoothly through Github. Furthermore, I took care of restructuring the project's documentation in terms of file reorganization and addition of missing sections.

In terms of PO-related work, our communication with the client was stalled because of a failed end-of-sprint meeting, which not able to attend. However, because of the good basis and knowledge of the end goals of the project we have come to cultivate, we were able to prepare and continue work for the next sprint as per usual.
