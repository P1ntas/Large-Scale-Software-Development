# Factsheet for Jos√© Castro

## Sprint 0

### General Contributions

Contributed towards the approval of the initial technology common basis, took part in the writing of the initial user stories and helped organize the project backlog. Actively established contact with the client and setup the communication environment.

## Sprint 1

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * Team 2's Issues - DINASORE Implementation, Dockerization and other DINASORE-related backlog items

### General Contributions

Continued working with the client to further understand the need for the DINASORE technology in this project. Familiarized myself with the development environment and technologies so I could better communicate the team's questions and feedback in more technical questions, and followed the team's progress closely to source out doubts that needed to be answered. Prepared sprint backlog with the help of the team.

## Sprint 2

### The two user stories that I am most proud of
- [#62 - Setup CI/CD Environment](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/62)
- [#82- Job Scheduling Feature](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/82)

### General Contributions

Continuous communication with the team. Familiarized myself with CI/CD environments and cloud services for production servers and started said setup of production server, and drew up the issues to tackle these needs. Communicated with client to understand priorities moving forward.


## Sprint 3

### General consideration

Along with my Product Owner duties, I actively participated in the setup of the both the deployment server and the automation of said deployment, which I started in the middle of the last sprint. Because of problems with the virtual machine, which had to be setup three different times because of crashes over an extended period of time (presumably due to the heavy load the DINASORE and SonarQube containers); and problems with the Github Action for deployment, whose functionalities were not fully working (a common problem that came up when discussing deployment automation with other colleagues), my progress was halted significantly. However, I am sure that, by the end of the first week of the next sprint, everything will be deploying smoothly through Github. Furthermore, I took care of restructuring the project's documentation in terms of file reorganization and addition of missing sections.

In terms of PO-related work, our communication with the client was stalled because of a failed end-of-sprint meeting, which not able to attend. However, because of the good basis and knowledge of the end goals of the project we have come to cultivate, we were able to prepare and continue work for the next sprint as per usual.

### User stories that I am most proud of
- [Job Scheduling: Visualization](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/102): this issue was created from one of my previous user stories
- [Development Sheet Additions](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/63)

### Pull requests that I am most proud of
- [Development Sheet Additions](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/63)
- [Development Sheet Restructuring and Additions](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/98)
- [Deployment Documentation](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/115)

## Sprint 4

### General consideration

Along with my Product Owner duties, I stayed up-to-date on the team's assigned tasks and, as previously done, helped clean and finish up the sprint, as well as taking care of deployment and release.

As a PO, I created several new issues and user stories to be done in a hypothetical Sprint 5, taking into consideration feedback from my team, client and global goals. Although the meeting with the client was pushed back to a later date (19/12/2023), our work was met with overall positive feedback.

### User stories that I am most proud of
- [Production Workflow Management: Update Task](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/159)
- [Production Workflow Management: Identify Bottlenecks or Delays in Real Time](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/122)
- [DINASORE: Integration with Live Sensors](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/157)

### Pull requests that I am most proud of
- [Setup CI/CD Environment](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/62)

## Overall Product

### Technical Soundness

From my point of view, the technologies used are correspondent with what this project and architecture asked, and their choice of usage is already explained in the different other documents in this project. Their implementation in this project was streamlined to be as easy as possible to build upon. The only problem I can trace in these contexts are the usage of the 4DIAC-IDE, as a manual setup is needed every time a new sensor is added, and this must also be done on the remote server.
In general, I think the technical soundness of the project is one of the things we can most be proud of.

### Product Realization

The features implemented were in-line with the goals outlined by the client. Their implementation borders on every point we discussed with the client and obey the technical constraints required. The features in which we (Team 2) worked on were implemented thoroughly and documented accordingly. However, the final product is missing the integration between the Machine Learning component and the rest of the project.

### Value for the Client

The feedback received from the client was mostly positive, as most of the project requirements were met and handover questions were discussed and rested. This project served as a testing ground for, specifically, DINASORE and 4DIAC-IDE usage, which was a point the client made right at the start, and one of the main tasks our team realized. In our understanding, what we gathered from its implementation will be useful going forward, as it was also discussed that there might be further work done on top of it.
