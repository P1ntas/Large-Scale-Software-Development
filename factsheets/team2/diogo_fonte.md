# Factsheet for Diogo Fonte

## Sprint 0

Since this sprint was mainly used for the creation of user stories and other related content, there was no real contributions on my part.


## Sprint 1

### General considerations
Participated in meetings held to develop and discuss DINASORE, in order to contribute. I had problems installing 4DIAC-IDE on the Mac, thus not being able to perform any PR. I am looking for a solution, finding a way to use another computer in order to contribute in the development of the DINASORE function blocks.
Contributed with some ideas/thoughts and participated in the integration of DINASORE in the meetings we held throughout the sprint. Understood the workflow of DINASORE in the project, reading the tutorials and seing the results of my colleagues.


## Sprint 2

### General considerations
In this third sprint, I worked on the dinasore dockerization with help of my colleagues to fix some errors regarding the dinasore instances for the 4DIAC and for the UPC UA Server. I have also helped updating some documentation regarding the new sensor and the product build.
