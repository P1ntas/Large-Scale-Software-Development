# Factsheet for Diogo Fonte

## Sprint 0

Since this sprint was mainly used for the creation of user stories and other related content, there was no real contributions on my part.


## Sprint 1

### General considerations
Participated in meetings held to develop and discuss DINASORE, in order to contribute. I had problems installing 4DIAC-IDE on the Mac, thus not being able to perform any PR. I am looking for a solution, finding a way to use another computer in order to contribute in the development of the DINASORE function blocks.
Contributed with some ideas/thoughts and participated in the integration of DINASORE in the meetings we held throughout the sprint. Understood the workflow of DINASORE in the project, reading the tutorials and seing the results of my colleagues.


## Sprint 2

### General considerations
In this third sprint, I worked on the dinasore dockerization with help of my colleagues to fix some errors regarding the dinasore instances for the 4DIAC and for the UPC UA Server. I have also helped updating some documentation regarding the new sensor and the product build.

#### Pull request that I am most proud of
* [#52](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/52)

#### The user story that I am most proud of

## Sprint 3

### General considerations
In this third sprint, I worked on the CI integration, more specifically on the implementation and documentation of the Bandit workflow.

#### Pull request that I am most proud of

## Sprint 4

### General considerations
During the final sprint of the project, with other academic obligations and job commitments, I was unable to contribute to the development of the product. However, I always tried to stay up to date and participate in the decisions necessary for the final phase of the project. Besides that, I reviewed pull requests.

## Overall Product

### Technical Soundness

The chosen technologies align with the project requirements and architecture, as detailed in the project documentation. Their implementation was designed for ease of extension. The main issue identified is the manual setup required in 4DIAC-IDE when adding a new sensor, necessitating the same setup on the remote server. Overall, the project's technical soundness is a notable achievement.

### Product Realization

Implemented features align closely with client goals and adhere to specified technical constraints. Team 2's contributions were thorough and well-documented. Notably, the final product lacks integration between the Machine Learning component and the rest of the project.

### Value for the Client

Client feedback was largely positive, acknowledging the fulfillment of most project requirements and successful resolution of handover questions.
