# Factsheet for Alexandre Costa

## Sprint 0

Since this sprint was mainly used for the creation of user stories and other related content, there was no real contributions on my part.

## Sprint 1

In this sprint, I participated in the meetings that were held to discuss and develop the program in DINASORE. Since it is still early in the development of the program, there wasn't much I could do to participate in the development of the program (besides the meetings), so I didn't do much.

## Sprint 2

In this sprint, I worked on the dockerization of Dinasore and had my teammates join me to help me fix some issues that we were having. I also helped writing the documentation for it.

## Sprint 4

In this final sprint, I was unable to contribute to the development of the product. However, besides staying up to date and participate in the decisions necessary for the final phase of the project, I reviewed and approved pull requests.

## Overall Product

### Technical Soundness

The chosen technologies align with the project requirements and architecture, as detailed in the project documentation. Their implementation was designed for ease of extension. The main issue identified is the manual setup required in 4DIAC-IDE when adding a new sensor, necessitating the same setup on the remote server. Overall, the project's technical soundness is a notable achievement.

### Product Realization

Implemented features align closely with client goals and adhere to specified technical constraints. Team 2's contributions were thorough and well-documented. Notably, the final product lacks integration between the Machine Learning component and the rest of the project.

### Value for the Client

Client feedback was largely positive, acknowledging the fulfillment of most project requirements and successful resolution of handover questions.
