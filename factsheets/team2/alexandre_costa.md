# Factsheet for Alexandre Costa

## Sprint 0

Since this sprint was mainly used for the creation of user stories and other related content, there was no real contributions on my part.

## Sprint 1

In this sprint, I participated in the meetings that were held to discuss and develop the program in DINASORE. Since it is still early in the development of the program, there wasn't much I could do to participate in the development of the program (besides the meetings), so I didn't do much.

## Sprint 2

In this sprint, I worked on the dockerization of Dinasore and had my teammates join me to help me fix some issues that we were having. I also helped writing the documentation for it.
