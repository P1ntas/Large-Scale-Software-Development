# Factsheet for Vítor Cavaleiro

## Sprint 0

Contributed by sharing thoughts and opinions concerning the initial user stories.

## Sprint 1

### General considerations
During this sprint, I aimed to understand the DINASORE tool's workflow. To achieve this, I followed the provided tutorials, studied the tool's architecture, and participated in the team meetings for further development and planning. In addition to this, the team conducted a practical test using a customized pipeline that closely matched the client's requirements. I was responsible for writing unit tests for the implemented function blocks.

### Two contributions that I am most proud of
- Set up and studied DINASORE. Shared thoughts about the tool with colleagues.
- Created unit tests for the pipeline created by [João Araújo](../factsheets/team1/joao_araujo.md), contributing for the product quality.

### Pull Requests Made
- The inclusion of the unit tests, which can be found [here](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/commit/f27b58669f545f5121a45e5d4119ea4918d5571b).


## Sprint 2

### General considerations

In this sprint, my primary focus was on elevating the development workflow by delving into and incorporating static analysis tools. I proposed a suite of tools to our scrum masters, and successfully integrated SonarQube into our project.
This approach holds significant promise in enhancing code quality and identifying potential issues at this stage of development. SonarQube, a robust static analysis tool, brings valuable insights into code quality, security vulnerabilities, and code smells on the project.

### Three contributions that I am most proud of
- Establish a local SonarQube instance to facilitate team-wide testing of code quality.
- Develop comprehensive documentation for SonarQube, covering setup instructions and configuration details.
- Provide descriptions of identified code vulnerabilities and insights into code quality based on SonarQube analysis.

### Pull Requests Made
- The integration of SonarQube, which can be found [here](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/73).


## Sprint 3

### General considerations

During this sprint, I concentrated on enhancing code analysis tools. The integration of Tox, an automated testing tool, simplified the code testing process and introduced the ability to generate test coverage reports—an aspect previously lacking in SonarQube. The combined use of these tools has made the generation and visualization of test coverage possible.

### Two contributions that I am most proud of
- Configure a local SonarQube instance and automatic test tool that enables test coverage visualization.
- Develop documentation for creating and visualizing test coverage with setup instructions.

### Pull Requests Made
- The integration of tox and test coverage for SonarQube, which can be found [here](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/116).
- Fixed configuration that was genrating conflicts with github actions, which can be found [here](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/120).

## Sprint 4

### General considerations

In the course of this sprint, I conducted a conclusive SonarQube analysis on the repository and delivered a final quality and security assurance report.

### Two contributions that I am most proud of
- Provide descriptions of identified code vulnerabilities and insights into code quality based on SonarQube analysis.
- Develop a final quality and security assurance report.

### Pull Requests Made
- Documentation update for quality assurance and security concerns [here](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/164).
