We completed the tasks we set out to do in this sprint succefully. We tested how real-time notifications work with both email and Discord integration and we discover is feasible.

As a Product Owner, it was my role during the meeting with the client to ask pertinent questions about our feature in order to clarify my team's doubts. For exmple, the type of data we would receive from the sensors to understand which alerts would be relevant to send to users.
