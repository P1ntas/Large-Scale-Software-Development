# Factsheet for Luis Paiva

## Sprint 0

In my role as the Product Owner (PO), I actively participated in all client meetings to gain a deep understanding of their requirements, enabling me to effectively convey this information to my team. Additionally, I provided assistance in drafting the initial user stories and helped to organize the product backlog.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

 * #1
 * #2


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint.

 * #3
 * #4


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

This can be anything that you think worked particularly well and benefited the project as whole, from a hard conversation with the PO that worked out very well, to the adoption of a new framework or library. 



## Sprint 1

As stated in the development document, the work the team developed during this sprint was mainly related to implementing automatic notifications linked to the data visualization interface, Grafana, and its dashboards.

None Relevant

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

We completed the tasks we set out to do in this sprint succefully. We tested how real-time notifications work with both email and Discord integration and we discover is feasible.

As a Product Owner, it was my role during the meeting with the client to ask pertinent questions about our feature in order to clarify my team's doubts. For example, the type of data we would receive from the sensors to understand which alerts would be relevant to send to users. 

## Sprint 2

This sprint, the first important task that was done was tackle the unexpected setup complexities, particularly with the dynamic data generators, based on Dinasore and 4DIAC-IDE. After this, the work progressed swiftly and we were able to quickly implement various notifications for sensors (e.g. value is higher than X, value is lower than Y). Also, when the values are restored to normal conditions, another automatic notificarion is sent, but this time marking the problem as resolved. Despite being complete, thi feature might need refinement in teh future, as new data types arise and more data is available, which will enable us to define more suitable ranges for each type of sensor (e.g. temperature, pressure, etc.). So, adaptability and problem-solving skills were evident in addressing challenges related to the project setup and the integration of the Prometheus data simulator in this sprint, and, despite setbacks, everyone contributed significantly to the successful implementation of the assigned user story.

As a Product Owner, I attended meetings with the client to grasp the client's perspective.
### The user storie that I am most proud of

 * [#5](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/5) - Implemented automatic notifications based on value ranges for sensor dynamic data

 ### The pull request that I am most proud of

* [#91](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/91)  - Implemented alerting/notification features

 ### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

During this sprint we could successfully overcome the initial setup difficulties, and we were able to implement the automatic notifications feature using dynamic data, which was the main goal of this sprint.

More testing, validation and betetr organization of the repository and overall work was also a point of focus during this sprint. Also, code review was taken more seriously, and we were able to improve the quality of the code that was being pushed to the dev branch.


## Sprint 3
During this project phase, as the Product Owner, i maintaned a continuous communication with the team to ensure a seamless workflow. While regrettably, we didn't have the opportunity to meet with the client this week, we have gained a clearer understanding of their requirements. Moving forward, I remain dedicated to facilitating effective communication and collaboration within the team, ensuring that our development aligns seamlessly with the client's expectations and project goals.

### The user storie that I am most proud of

* None relevant, as we did not implement any code.

 ### The pull request that I am most proud of

* None relevant, as we did not implement any code.

 ### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

During this sprint, I communicated my team's work to the other product owners and shared other product owners ideas with my team.

I helped to refine the product backlog.

## Sprint 4

During this sprint, as the Product Owner, I upheld ongoing communication within the team for a smooth workflow. Regrettably, the final meeting with the client was postponed, but we made productive use of the time to deepen our understanding of their requirements, refining one of our previous user stories. I also checked the sub-tasks the team was focused in implementing made sense to the project.

### The user storie that I am most proud of

* [#5](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/5) - Implemented automatic notifications based on value ranges for sensor dynamic data - updated to feature Go's templating language and more accurate parameters

 ### The pull request that I am most proud of

* None relevant, as we did not implement any code.

 ### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

I facilitated cross-team collaboration by presenting our progress and initiatives to fellow product owners. Also, I played a crucial role in promoting knowledge exchange by sharing valuable insights and ideas from other product owners with my team.

I helped to refine the product backlog.

## Overall Product

Reflect on your specific contributions to the product, technically and as perceived by a user, along the three dimensions below (see Dashboard > Final outcomes > Product). Keep each section below to a maximum of 50 words.


### Technical Soundness

As a PO, I was not deeply involved in the technical aspects of the project. However, I was able to understand the technical aspects of the project and communicate them to the client. I also helped my team to understand the (sometimes vague) client's requirements and to implement them in the project.


### Product Realization

As a PO, my main focus was to facilitate communication between the team and the client, by attending all the meetings with the client and communicating his requirements to my team. I also helped to refine the product backlog and to ensure that the team was working well.

### Value for the Client

I think my contributions were important to make the end producted more aligned with the client's requirements, thus increasing its value. However, I think the result could have been much more interesting if the client showed more interest in the project and made the requirements clearer.
