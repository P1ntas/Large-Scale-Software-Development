# Factsheet for Luis Paiva

## Sprint 0

In my role as the Product Owner (PO), I actively participated in all client meetings to gain a deep understanding of their requirements, enabling me to effectively convey this information to my team. Additionally, I provided assistance in drafting the initial user stories and helped to organize the product backlog.


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

 * #1
 * #2


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint.

 * #3
 * #4


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

This can be anything that you think worked particularly well and benefited the project as whole, from a hard conversation with the PO that worked out very well, to the adoption of a new framework or library. 



## Sprint 1

As stated in the development document, the work the team developed during this sprint was mainly related to implementing automatic notifications linked to the data visualization interface, Grafana, and its dashboards.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

We completed the tasks we set out to do in this sprint succefully. We tested how real-time notifications work with both email and Discord integration and we discover is feasible.

As a Product Owner, it was my role during the meeting with the client to ask pertinent questions about our feature in order to clarify my team's doubts. For example, the type of data we would receive from the sensors to understand which alerts would be relevant to send to users. 

## Sprint 2

This sprint, the first important task that was done was tackle the unexpected setup complexities, particularly with the dynamic data generators, based on Dinasore and 4DIAC-IDE. After this, the work progressed swiftly and we were able to quickly implement various notifications for sensors (e.g. value is higher than X, value is lower than Y). Also, when the values are restored to normal conditions, another automatic notificarion is sent, but this time marking the problem as resolved. Despite being complete, thi feature might need refinement in teh future, as new data types arise and more data is available, which will enable us to define more suitable ranges for each type of sensor (e.g. temperature, pressure, etc.). So, adaptability and problem-solving skills were evident in addressing challenges related to the project setup and the integration of the Prometheus data simulator in this sprint, and, despite setbacks, everyone contributed significantly to the successful implementation of the assigned user story.

As a Product Owner, I attended meetings with the client to grasp the client's perspective.
### The user storie that I am most proud of

 * [#5](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/5) - Implemented automatic notifications based on value ranges for sensor dynamic data

 ### The pull request that I am most proud of

* [#91](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/pull/91)  - Implemented alerting/notification features

 ### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

During this sprint we could successfully overcome the initial setup difficulties, and we were able to implement the automatic notifications feature using dynamic data, which was the main goal of this sprint.

More testing, validation and betetr organization of the repository and overall work was also a point of focus during this sprint. Also, code review was taken more seriously, and we were able to improve the quality of the code that was being pushed to the dev branch.
