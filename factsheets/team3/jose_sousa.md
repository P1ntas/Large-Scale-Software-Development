# Factsheet for JosÃ© Sousa

## Sprint 0

While I successfully set up Grafana on Docker containers, ensuring a stable development environment, my contributions during this sprint were limited and I didn't make any substancial constributions to the project, as this sprint 0 primarily focused on creating user stories, defining the vision of the product and related content. 


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

 * #1
 * #2


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint.

 * #3
 * #4


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

This can be anything that you think worked particularly well and benefited the project as whole, from a hard conversation with the PO that worked out very well, to the adoption of a new framework or library. 



## Sprint 1

As stated in the development document, the work the team developed during this sprint was mainly related to implementing automatic notifications linked to the data visualization interface, Grafana, and its dashboards. 

### Two user stories that I am most proud of

 * [#5](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/5) - Implemented an automatic notification for testing purposes with different data and delivery endpoints

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

None relevant

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of 

We successfully achieved this testing the implementation both with an email endpoint and a Discord bot (webhook). This helped us prove that having real-time notifications is feasible, and the pull request with the complete code for this feature will be done during sprint 2, when we have real-time data being streamed to the dashboards, as only then we can create more types of notifications and complete the testing process. We also need to figure out a way to ensure user acknowledgement and tracking.
