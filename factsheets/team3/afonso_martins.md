# Factsheet for Afonso Martins

## Sprint 0

Sprint 0 was a crucial initial phase dedicated to shaping the project's roadmap by crafting user stories and related content. As the Scrum Master, my contributions, while less prominent in terms of direct development work, played an essential role in orchestrating the team's efforts and ensuring the success of this preparatory phase.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

 * #1
 * #2


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

This can include PRs that you have implemented or reviewed during the sprint.

 * #3
 * #4


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

This can be anything that you think worked particularly well and benefited the project as whole, from a hard conversation with the PO that worked out very well, to the adoption of a new framework or library. 



## Sprint 1

As stated in the development document, the work the team developed during this sprint was mainly related to implementing automatic notifications linked to the data visualization interface, Grafana, and its dashboards. 

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

 * [#5](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2023-1MEIC06/DS-Project/issues/13) - Implemented an automatic notification for testing purposes with different data and delivery endpoints


### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

None relevant


### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

We successfully achieved the objectives for this sprint, testing the implementation of the notifications both with an email endpoint and a Discord bot (webhook). The tasks developed during this sprint helped us prove that having real-time notifications is feasible, and the pull request with the complete code for this feature will be done during sprint 2, when we have real-time data being streamed to the dashboards, as only then we can create more types of notifications and complete the testing process. We also need to figure out a way to ensure user acknowledgement and tracking.

As a Scrum Master, I also helped organize the teamâ€™s workflow during the sprint.
