# Factsheet for Eduardo Silva

## Sprint 0

While I successfully set up Grafana on Docker containers, ensuring a stable development environment, my contributions during this sprint were limited and I didn't make any substancial constributions to the project, as this sprint 0 primarily focused on creating user stories, defining the vision of the product and related content. 


### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

### Two contributions of other types that I am most proud of

This can be anything that you think worked particularly well and benefited the project as whole, from a hard conversation with the PO that worked out very well, to the adoption of a new framework or library.
